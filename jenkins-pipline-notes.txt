1) for our setup , we are running jenkins as a container in docker 
 - in order to build and run containers the jenkins has to have connection or communicate with docker engine 
 - since this container cant speak with the docker container directly we use 
 - alpine/socat container to forward traffic from Jenkins to Docker Desktop on Host Machine
 
 this is achieved using the following command
 
 - docker run -d --restart=always -p 127.0.0.1:2376:2375 --network jenkins -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock alpine/socat tcp-listen:2375,fork,reuseaddr unix-connect:/var/	run/docker.sock
 
 -docker inspect <container_id> | grep IPAddress
 
 from this we copy the ip address and paste in the docker host url
 
 
 - IMPORTANT 

1) had to delete the older version or the one i was using and create a new jenkins in docker 
2) reason was old verison was trying to talk to docker using tcp which was not working and a decrepatted thing i believe
3) intalled and mounted socket where docker can listen 
4) 
# Step 1: Get container name
docker ps

# Step 2-4: Install Docker and restart
docker exec -u root -it jenkins bash -c "apt-get update && apt-get install -y docker.io && usermod -aG docker jenkins"

docker restart jenkins

docker exec -u root -it jenkins chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock

this fixed and helped me run the pipline
